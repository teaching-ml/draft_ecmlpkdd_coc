# Draft Code of Conduct for the ECMLPKDD conference

This repo is meant as a central point of contact for the Draft Code of Conduct for the [ECMLPKDD2020](https://ecmlpkdd2020.net/) conference. Feel free to participate. 

The main document is [draft.md](draft.md). It was originally adopted by @HeidiBaya from the code of conduct for [useR! 2020](https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/) and posted [here](https://hackmd.io/sXV_Et2lRfShUiGOjSHLGw?edit).
